The card also normally remains the property of the person who played it, not the winner of that trick; to compensate for this in the scoring count, the owner of the Excuse should instead give the winner of the trick a half-point card (a trump other than an oudler, or a suited number card; see Scoring) from his or her score pile.\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "Two common exceptions to the above behaviors are seen when the Excuse is played on the last trick, and what happens depends on whether the side playing the Fool has taken all the previous tricks (see Chelem/Slam below). If the side has taken all previous tricks, the card takes the last trick; if not, it changes hands to the other side, even if the trick is won by a partner or fellow defender of the person playing it."
				+ "Three-player variant\n"
				+ "The dog consists of six cards, each hand of 24 cards, dealt in packets of three. 13 trumps are needed for a single handful, 15 for a double handful, 18 for a triple."
				+ "Scoring\n"
				+ "When the last trick has been played, the round ends. The taker counts the number of oudlers and the point value of all cards in his scoring pile. Alternatively, if the taker has taken the majority of tricks, the defenders can pool their scoring piles and count their oudlers and points; the taker has all remaining points.\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "Value of the cards\n"
				+ "Cards for scoring purposes are divided into two groups: \"counters\" (face cards and oudlers) and \"ordinary\" cards or cartes basses (any suited pip card, and any trump except the 1 and 21). Cards are paired, with each counter matched to an ordinary card, and remaining ordinary cards are also paired. The values of pairs are then counted and summed:\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "1 King or oudler + 1 ordinary card: 5 points\n"
				+ "1 Queen + 1 ordinary card: 4 points\n"
				+ "1 Knight + 1 ordinary card: 3 points\n"
				+ "1 Jack + 1 ordinary card: 2 points\n"
				+ "2 ordinary cards: 1 point\n"
				+ "Each card thus has an individual value; the pairing simply makes it easier to count points. If a card cannot be paired, because there are an odd number in the scoring pile (common with three or five players) or more counters than ordinary cards:\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "Kings and oudlers are worth 4+1‚ÅÑ2 points each;\n"
				+ "Queens are worth 3+1‚ÅÑ2;\n"
				+ "Knights are worth 2+1‚ÅÑ2;\n"
				+ "Jacks are worth 1+1‚ÅÑ2;\n"
				+ "All other cards are worth 1‚ÅÑ2 point.\n"
				+ "Winning\n"
				+ "The number of points the taker needs depends on how many of the oudlers (Excuse, Petit, 21 of trumps) are among his won tricks.\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "With 3 oudlers the taker needs at least 36 card points to win;\n"
				+ "With 2 oudlers the taker needs at least 41 card points to win;\n"
				+ "With 1 oudler the taker needs at least 51 card points to win;\n"
				+ "With none the taker needs at least 56 card points to win.\n"
				+ "There are 91 points to be taken in a round, so if the taker has:\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "3 oudlers, the defenders need at least 55+1‚ÅÑ2 card points to win;\n"
				+ "2 oudlers, the defenders need at least 50+1‚ÅÑ2 card points to win;\n"
				+ "1 oudler, the defenders need at least 40+1‚ÅÑ2 card points to win;\n"
				+ "no oudler, the defenders need at least 35+1‚ÅÑ2 card points to win.");
